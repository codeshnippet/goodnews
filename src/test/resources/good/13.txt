his famous Japanese dog was so devoted, he waited for his deceased owner for eleven years.
It’s not only humans who are memorialized in statue. When University of Tokyo professor Hidesamuro Ueno first got his dog Hachiko in 1924, the Akita would send him off at the front door, and then patiently wait by the nearest railroad station for his owner to come home. Ueno died a year later, but that didn’t stop Hachiko from waiting everyday at the station until his own death eleven years later. Every year, Hachiko’s devotion is honored at a solemn ceremony at the Shibuya railroad station where a statue of him stands in his honor.
