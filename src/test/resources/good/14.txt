This made us wonder if we could train our dogs to drive. Apparently these people did.
In New Zealand, three dogs learned how to drive cars. Seriously. With what we’re assuming took a lot of training (and treats), these dogs were taught how to put a car in gear, press the accelerator and steer with their paws. They went about 20 mph, and didn’t even crash. Better than some drivers we know. The experiment was conducted by the Auckland Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in an effort to prove canine intelligence and promote dog adoptions in shelters.
