My family and I rescued Anakin and I am caring for him. My family and I are lifelong animal lovers and will give Ani the absolute best possible home, love and care. I will be posting updates, photos and videos of Anakin on his Facebook page, Twitter and YouTube as he grows.
We have a new kitten! A very special new kitten. I wasn't looking to get another cat right now but you know how these things just happen.... About two weeks ago a kitten without back legs started coming over to eat with the other feral cats at my dad's work. My first few trips to attempt to catch it didn't work out. Then Thursday (5/31), We went to see if this was the day we could catch it. The kitten was cowering in the bushes and I climbed into the bushes and pulled the kitten out. We brought the kitten home and I set it up in our hall bathroom, exactly like I did with Trixie & Pixie two years earlier.
Friday morning (6/1) I took him to our vet as soon as they opened. Our vet said she has never seen anything like him before and he is amazing and that it's also amazing that his mother took care of him even with his handicap. She examined him and he is a little boy, approximately 6 to 8 weeks old and it in really good health. Two xrays on him showed he was born with no pelvis or back legs. We let him walk around the room for a minute to see how he moves. He positions his front legs at an angle towards the middle of his body and balances his backend in the air with the use of his tail touching the ground if he needs it. He gets around really well that way and is pretty quick too. The xray also showed that his insides were not malformed, last was the feline leukemia test. He's came back negative. So we got him vaccinated, dewormed and a little flea meds and unless we have any problems with him, he goes back to the vet in three weeks. :)
