"BUB is a 'perma-kitten', which means she will stay kitten sized and maintain kitten-like features her entire life. She is also a dwarf, which means her limbs are disproportionately small relative to the rest of her body. She has very short, stubbly legs and a weird, long, serpent-like body. Her lower jaw is very short compared to her upper jaw, and her teeth never grew in (thus, she's toothless), which is why her tongue is usually hanging out.... BUB is a polydactyl cat... in her case, one extra toe on all of her four paws. Her front paws each have two opposable thumbs. And then of course there are her big, bulging, wonder-filled green eyes. Some think she can see into the future with those things," said on Lil Bub's FB page.

Despite BUB's "deformities", she is rather healthy and happy. "She may not be able to jump on and off stuff, but she manages by climbing using her 22 claws.... Even though she has no teeth, she has a fierce appetite, and can take down half a bowl of dry food without any problems.... She is just one of nature's happy accidents."
