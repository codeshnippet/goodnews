A litter of kittens were rescued by a once homeless squirell who found them inside a box atop a trash heap, in a neighborhood near São Paulo, Brazil's Jardim Aeroporto. "He gently tore the box apart, and then carried the kittens—one by one—back to his human’s home," reported Pawnation.
The squirell named Banzé (or “Scamp”) is also a rescue from the streets. "So when he heard the plaintive mews of an abandoned litter of kittens, he didn't hesitate to save them, as he had once been saved." (Pawnation)
