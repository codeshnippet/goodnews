Adorable Girl Meets Kitten For the First Time and Cries Tears of Pure Joy
A nine-year-old girl cried tears of joy when she came home from a friend’s house one day and found a tiny black kitten in her bedroom.
All this happened last summer when Marley’s mother, Nikki, brought home a black kitten that was found under her friend’s porch with her sibling. It was believed that their mother had been killed on the road. The little black kitty was a mini version of Marley’s best friend Simon the cat, who sadly had passed away the year before.
“Marley’s a big animal lover. She’s always putting her change in the donation cans at the pet supply store, and we already have two dogs, two cats and a guinea pig in our family,” explained Nikki. “Our elderly black cat Simon had passed away the year before and she’d been asking for a kitten since.”
As the family already had two cats they had no intention of getting another, that is until Ella came along.
“I had no intention of bringing another cat home, but… sometimes you just know these things are meant to be.” So she brought little Ella home and placed her in Marley’s room, waiting for her daughter to return. “Marley had NO IDEA, she had come home from a friend’s house and the rest is history!”

Marley and Ella have grown in leaps and bounds since this summer. The two buddies share a very special bond. “Ella is a great cat, very friendly and cuddly.” Something was missing in Marley’s heart after she lost Simon. When little Ella the rescue kitten came to live with the family her heart was filled with joy.
