Rory the cat won over the Internet when a video of her day dreaming away on a car dashboard went viral. While we don’t recommend cats roam free in moving vehicles for safety reasons, we were very impressed with Rory’s cool demeanor, especially while in the car, which most cats tend to despise. Unfortunately, little Rory lost her battle with lymphoma and FIP this summer, but her legacy lives on her Instagram page, which is dedicated to spreading awareness and support to animals in need.
